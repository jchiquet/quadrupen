\usage{
group.lasso(
  x,
  y,
  group,
  type = 2,
  lambda1 = NULL,
  lambda2 = 0.01,
  penscale = switch(as.character(type), `2` = rep(sqrt(pk), pk), inf = rep(1, p)),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of features, possibly sparsely encoded
(experimental). Do NOT include intercept. When normalized os
\code{TRUE}, coefficients will then be rescaled to the original
scale.}

\item{y}{response vector.}

\item{group}{vector of interers indicating group belonging. Must
match the number fo column in \code{x}. Must be SORTED integers
starting from 1.}

\item{type}{string indicating wether the
\eqn{\ell_1/\ell_2}{l1/l2} or the
\eqn{\ell_1/\ell_\infty}{l1/linf} group-Lasso must be fitted.}

\item{lambda1}{sequence of decreasing \eqn{\ell_1}{l1}-penalty
levels. If \code{NULL} (the default), a vector is generated with
\code{nlambda1} entries, starting from a guessed level
\code{lambda1.max} where only the intercept is included, then
shrunken to \code{min.ratio*lambda1.max}.}

\item{lambda2}{real scalar; tunes the \eqn{\ell_2}{l2}
penalty. Default is 0.01. Set to 0 to recover the usual
group-Lasso.}

\item{penscale}{vector with real positive values that weight the
\eqn{\ell_1}{l1}-penalty of each feature.}

\item{struct}{matrix structuring the coefficients, possibly
sparsely encoded. Must be at least positive semidefinite (this is
checked internally if the \code{checkarg} argument is
\code{TRUE}). If \code{NULL} (the default), the identity matrix is
used. See details below.}

\item{intercept}{logical; indicates if an intercept should be
included in the model. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{normalize}{logical; indicates if variables should be
normalized to have unit L2 norm before fitting.  Default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{naive}{logical; Compute either 'naive' of classic version:
as defined for the Elastic-net in Zou and Hastie (2006), the
vector of parameters is rescaled by a coefficient
\code{(1+lambda2)} when \code{naive} equals \code{FALSE}.  No
rescaling otherwise.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{nlambda1}{integer that indicates the number of values to put
in the \code{lambda1} vector.  Ignored if \code{lambda1} is
provided.}

\item{min.ratio}{minimal value of \eqn{\ell_1}{l1}-part of the
penalty that will be tried, as a fraction of the maximal
\code{lambda1} value. A too small value might lead to unstability
at the end of the solution path corresponding to small
\code{lambda1}.  The default value tries to avoid this, adapting
to the '\eqn{n<p}{n<p}' context. Ignored if \code{lambda1} is
provided.}

\item{max.feat}{integer; limits the number of features ever to
enter the model; i.e., non-zero coefficients for the Lasso: the
algorithm stops if this number is exceeded and \code{lambda1} is
cutted at the corresponding level. Default is
\code{min(nrow(x),ncol(x))}. Use with care, as it considerably
changes the computation time.}

\item{beta0}{a starting point for the vector of parameter. The
default is a vector of zeros. May save time in some situation.}

\item{control}{list of argument controlling low level options of
the algorithm --use with care and at your own risk-- :
\itemize{%

\item{\code{verbose}: }{integer; activate verbose mode --this one
is not too much risky!-- set to \code{0} for no output; \code{1}
for warnings only, and \code{2} for tracing the whole
progression. Default is \code{1}. Automatically set to \code{0}
when the method is embedded within cross-validation or stability
selection.}

\item{\code{timer}: }{logical; use to record the timing of the
algorithm. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{\code{max.iter}: }{the maximal number of iteration used to
solve the problem for a given value of lambda1. Default is 500.}

\item{\code{method}: }{a string for the underlying solver
used. Either \code{"quadra"}, \code{"pathwise"} or
\code{"fista"}. Default is \code{"quadra"}.}

\item{\code{threshold}: }{a threshold for convergence. The
algorithm stops when the optimality conditions are fulfill up to
this threshold. Default is \code{1e-7} for \code{"quadra"} and
\code{1e-2} for the first order methods.}

\item{\code{monitor}: }{indicates if a monitoring of the
convergence should be recorded, by computing a lower bound between
the current solution and the optimum: when \code{'0'} (the
default), no monitoring is provided; when \code{'1'}, the bound
derived in Grandvalet et al. is computed; when \code{'>1'}, the
Fenchel duality gap is computed along the algorithm.}
}}

\item{checkargs}{logical; should arguments be checked to
(hopefully) avoid internal crashes? Default is
\code{TRUE}. Automatically set to \code{FALSE} when calls are made
from cross-validation or stability selection procedures.}

\description{
Adjust a linear model with group-lasso regularization, that is a
mixture of either a (possibly weighted)
\eqn{\ell_1/\ell_2}{l1/l2}- or
\eqn{\ell_1/\ell_\infty}{l1/linf}-norm, and a (possibly
structured) \eqn{\ell_2}{l2}-norm (ridge-like). The solution path
is computed at a grid of values for the
\eqn{\ell_1/\ell_q}{l1/lq}-penalty. See details for the criterion
optimized.
}
\note{
The optimized criterion is the following: \if{latex}{\deqn{%
\hat{\beta}_{\lambda_1} = \arg \min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2} (y - X
\beta)^T (y - X \beta) + \lambda_1 \|D \beta \|_{1}, }}

\if{text}{\deqn{beta.hat(lambda1) = argmin_beta 1/2
RSS(beta) + lambda1 |D beta|1,}} where
\eqn{D}{D} is a diagonal matrix, whose diagonal terms are provided
as a vector by the \code{penscale} argument.
